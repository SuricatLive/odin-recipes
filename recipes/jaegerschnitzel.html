    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This jägerschnitzel is a delicious dish I ordered again and again when I was <br>
        stationed in Germany with the Army. It is best served with French fries to <br>
        clean up the remaining gravy and a nice garden salad.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 pork steaks or cutlets, pounded thin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 cube beef bouillon</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place beaten egg in a shallow dish. Mix together bread crumbs and flour in <br>
                a second shallow dish; season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Dip pork steaks in beaten egg, then press into bread crumb mixture to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry coated steaks in hot <br>
                oil until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read <br>
                thermometer inserted into the center of steaks should read at least 145 degrees <br>
                F (63 degrees C). Remove steaks to a platter and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Add onion and mushrooms to drippings in the skillet; cook and stir until lightly <br>
                browned. Pour in water and stir in bouillon cube until dissolved. Simmer for <br>
                about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine sour cream and cornstarch in a small bowl; stir into the skillet. Cook <br>
                over low heat until sauce is thickened, but do not boil. Spoon sauce over steaks <br>
                to serve.</li>
        </ol>
